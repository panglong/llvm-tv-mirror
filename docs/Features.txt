LLVM-TV FEATURES

1. Current
==========

* Tabbed views of Modules and Functions: choose text or HTML
* Call graph display for a Module
* CFG display for a function
* Use/def chains for instructions
  - not polished: separate from syntax-highlighted view, multi-column
* BU, TD, or Local DSGraphs display for global vars and functions
* Tabbed view of graphs (CallGraph, CFG, DSA, ...)

2. Under development/debugging
==============================

* Scintilla / syntax-highlighting editing control
* Cycling through snapshots (prev, next) while keeping same function in view

3. Long-term ideas
==================

* Some other kind of pointer analysis viewer?
* Cache display of complex computed structures (graphs)
* Calculate graphs in the background -- user should be able to change tabs while
  the graph calculation is going on 
* Rewrite LLVM-TV in XUL
  + As portable as Mozilla
  + HTML/CSS for code (can use links and mouseover!)
  + SVG for graphs
