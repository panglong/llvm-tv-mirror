Design of LLVM-TV
-----------------

TVApplication implements the wxApp interface and is the launcher of LLVM-TV.

TVFrame sets up the main view of LLVM-TV: the split view with the list of
snapshots on the left (TVListCtl), and a tabbed view on the right (TVNotebook).

TVTreeItem is the abstract superclass for all nodes that appear in the tree of
LLVM-TV.  The root of the tree is the Singleton TVTreeRootItem which has no
displayable data.  The other subclasses of TVTreeItem are TVTreeFunctionItem and
TVTreeModuleItem which contain Function and Module objects, respectively,
corresponding to LLVM classes of the same name.

TVTreeItem uses HTMLPrinter to display a Function or a Module as a
syntax-highlighted view.  It also chooses a Strategy HTMLMarkup class to
decide on whether to use a CSS-marked-up version or a regular HTML-based
syntax-highlighting.

HTMLPrinter is a Visitor which uses the InstVisitor C++ template, which in turn
is an Iterator over the BasicBlocks of a Function, and all Instructions in a
BasicBlock.  HTMLMarkup is a Strategy object, implementing either a simple HTML
markup or one using CSS.  It is passed into HTMLPrinter which uses it to emit
syntax-highlighting for keywords, types, basic block names, etc.

TVNotebook is responsible for implementing the tabbed interface.

ItemDisplayer is the abstract superclass for objects that can be displayed in
tabs.  TVCodeViewer enables the view of use-def chains to live in a tab
interface.   because their parent class DSAGraphDrawer 

GraphDrawer is an abstract class specifying the interface for graph-drawing
visualizers.  It inherits the ItemDisplayer interface.

CallGraphDrawer and CFGGraphDrawer are GraphDrawers for displaying the call
graph (for a Module) and the CFG (for a Function), respectively.

DSAGraphDrawer is an abstract class using the Template Method for
DSA graph visualizers: it implements drawFunctionGraph() and drawModuleGraph()
in terms of pure virtual C++ functions that return the pass to draw a graph,
which is different for each of BUGraphDrawer, TDGraphDrawer, and
LocalGraphDrawer, as well as the filename to which they output the results of
their analysis.  The algorithm for running the pass on a Function or Module is
shared among the 3 subclasses of DSAGraphDrawer.

BUGraphDrawer, TDGraphDrawer, and LocalGraphDrawer are also ItemDisplayers,
which allows them to be displayed in tabs or in separate new windows.

PictureCanvas is the container of a graphical visualizers, supporting an image
display with scrolling.  PictureFrame is the window containing PictureCanvas and
intercepts window events.
