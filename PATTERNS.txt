Patterns used in LLVM-TV
------------------------

1. TVTreeItem uses HTMLPrinter to display a Function or a Module as a
   syntax-highlighted view.  It also chooses a Strategy HTMLMarkup class to
   decide on whether to use a CSS-marked-up version or a regular HTML-based
   syntax-highlighting.

   HTMLPrinter is a Visitor which uses the InstVisitor C++ template, which in
   turn is an Iterator over the BasicBlocks of a Function, and all Instructions
   in a BasicBlock.  It calls methods on the HTMLMarkup that it is instantiated
   with to emit syntax-highlighting for keywords, types, basic block names, etc.

2. TVTreeItem is the abstract superclass for all nodes that appear in the tree
   of LLVM-TV.  The root of the tree is the Singleton TVTreeRootItem which has
   no displayable data.  The other subclasses of TVTreeItem are
   TVTreeFunctionItem and TVTreeModuleItem which contain Function and Module
   objects, respectively, corresponding to LLVM classes of the same name.

3. The snapshots are encapsulated in the TVSnapshotList class...
