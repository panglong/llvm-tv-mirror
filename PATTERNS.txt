Patterns used in LLVM-TV
------------------------

1. TVTreeItem uses HTMLPrinter to display a Function or a Module as a
   syntax-highlighted view. It also chooses a Strategy HTMLMarkup class to
   decide on whether to use a CSS-marked-up version or a regular HTML-based
   syntax-highlighting.

   HTMLPrinter is a Visitor which uses the InstVisitor C++ template, which in
   turn is an Iterator over the BasicBlocks of a Function, and all Instructions
   in a BasicBlock. It calls methods on the HTMLMarkup that it is instantiated
   with to emit syntax-highlighting for keywords, types, basic block names, etc.
